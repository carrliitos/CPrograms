# Pointers and Arrays
- `Pointer`
	- a variable that contains the address of a variable.
	- used a lot in C because they sometimes are the only way to express a computation
	- usually lead to a more compact and efficient code
	- have been lumped with the `goto` statement
		- if used correctly, pointers can achieve clarity and simplicity
	- type `void *` (pointer to void) replaces `char *` as the proper type for a generic pointer
