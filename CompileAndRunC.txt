To compile:
	$ gcc -o hello hello.c
This command will invoke the GNU C compiler to compile the file hello.c and output (-o) the result to an executable called hello

To execute:
	$ ./hello

Optional Step:
In order to avoid the./prefix each time a program is to be executed, insert the following as the last line in the file .profile(located in your home folder):
	export PATH=.:$PATH
	
This step needs only to be done once.
