# C programming practice

## To compile:
<code>$ gcc -o hello hello.c</code>

This command will invoke the GNU C compiler to compile the file hello.c and output (-o) the result to an executable called hello

## To execute:
<code>$ ./hello</code>

## Optional Step:
In order to avoid the ./prefix each time a program is to be executed, insert the following as the last line in the file .profile(located in your home folder):
<code>export PATH=.:$PATH</code>
	
This step needs only to be done once.
